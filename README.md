**codemetrics4j** (formerly JaSoMe) is a Java source code analyzer that calculates insightful quality metrics without requiring project compilation.  This means you can analyze code even when dependencies are missing or code generation steps are incomplete.

Key Features:

- Compilation-free analysis: Get metrics directly from your .java files, streamlining the analysis process.
- File-level metrics: Provides granular metrics for classes and methods within each file.
- Package-level insights: Receive aggregated metrics at the package level.
- XML Output: Results are delivered in a structured XML format for easy integration.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was originally forked from https://github.com/rodhilton/jasome.  Due to the original repository being unmaintained, I've published my fork under the name `codemetrics4j`. This ensures easy access to the version containing the latest features and bug fixes.  The previous version can still be found at https://github.com/kdunee/jasome. 

# Getting Started

Download the latest distribution and unzip, change into directory, then run:

  ```
  bin/codemetrics4j <directory to analyze>
  ```
  
codemetrics4j will gather metrics and output them to the console.  You can save the XML
to a file using the `--output <file>` option.

# Metrics

codemetrics4j is currently tracking the following metrics:
   
 - [x] **Raw Total Lines of Code (RTLOC)** - The actual number of lines of code in a
   class, using the line numbers of the file itself.  Comments, whitespace, and
   everything else is counted. _(class)_

   comments, whitespace, and formatting differences _(project, package, class, method)_

   that it did not override or inherit _(class)_
